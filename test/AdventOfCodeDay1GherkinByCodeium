Feature: Load arrays from a file

  Scenario: File exists and has valid format
    Given a file with the following contents:
      """
      1,2
      3,4
      5,6
      """
    When I load arrays from the file
    Then the first array should be [1,3,5]
    And the second array should be [2,4,6]

  Scenario: File does not exist
    Given a non-existent file
    When I load arrays from the file
    Then the first array should be empty
    And the second array should be empty

  Scenario: File has invalid format
    Given a file with the following contents:
      """
      abc,def
      ghi,jkl
      """
    When I load arrays from the file
    Then the first array should be empty
    And the second array should be empty

Feature: Get differences between two arrays

  Scenario: Arrays have the same size
    Given two arrays: [1,2,3] and [4,5,6]
    When I get the differences between the arrays
    Then the result should be [3,3,3]

  Scenario: Arrays have different sizes
    Given two arrays: [1,2,3] and [4,5]
    When I get the differences between the arrays
    Then an error should be raised

Feature: Main program

  Scenario: File exists and has valid format
    Given a file with the following contents:
      """
      1,2
      3,4
      5,6
      """
    When I run the main program
    Then the differences between the two arrays should be [1,1,1]

  Scenario: File does not exist
    Given a non-existent file
    When I run the main program
    Then an error should be raised

  Scenario: File has invalid format
    Given a file with the following contents:
      """
      abc,def
      ghi,jkl
      """
    When I run the main program
    Then an error should be raised
